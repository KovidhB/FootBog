    <h1>Manchester city 3-2 Queens Park</h1>
    <p>Manchester City's triumph over Queens Park Rangers in the dying embers of the 2011/12 Premier League season is regarded as one of the finest Premier League matches ever played. It was incredibly close at the top of the standings, with arch rivals Manchester United attempting to unseat Man City. However, Djibril Cisse punished a mistake by Joleon Lescott, and Jamie Mackie regained the lead for QPR just after the hour mark. With barely seconds remaining, Edin Dzeko's superb header set up a thrilling climax, and Sergio Aguero's goal secured City's first title since 1968. This encounter lives on in the hearts of all those City supporters as well as in Premier League history books, earning a place on the list of "The 5 Greatest Football Matches in History."</p>
