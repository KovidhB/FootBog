    <p>Liverpool's chances of reaching the Champions League final seemed poor, but Divock Origi, Georginio Wijnaldum, and the rest of Jurgen Klopp's squad had other ideas. Lionel Messi dominated the first leg of the semi-final, but Origi poked home to give the tie new life. Wijnaldum was replaced by Andrew Robertson in the second half, and he scored twice in 122 seconds. This allowed Origi to score his second goal of the game, turning the tie around for the English. Liverpool would go on to win the final, defeating Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 to clinch their sixth Champions League or European Cup championship. </p>
